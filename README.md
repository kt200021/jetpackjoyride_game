# Introduction

This is a CLI platformer arcade game written in Python 3 and object oriented programming, heavily inspired by Jetpack Joyride.

Din is a mandalorian living in the post-empire era. He is one of the last remaining members of his clan in the galaxy and is currently on a mission for the Guild. He needs to rescue The Child, who strikingly resembles Master Yoda, a legendary Jedi grandmaster. But there are lots of enemies and obstacles in his way, trying to prevent Din from saving Baby Yoda. Din is wearing classic mandalorian armour and has a jetpack as well as a blaster with unlimited bullets. Youâ€™ve got to help him fight his way through and rescue Baby Yoda.
